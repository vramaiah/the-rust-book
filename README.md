# Learning Rust
As of December 2025, I'm currently learning rust out of ["The Rust Programming Language"](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/). This version has some additional quizzes, and it has been pretty helpful so far! 

## Why Rust?
Rust has a number of clear advantages over other languages:
* Memory Safety
* Performance
* Growing popularity (especially in Open Source)
